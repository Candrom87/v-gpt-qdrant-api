# v-gpt-qdrant-api

## Description

This repository contains a FastAPI application for interacting with Qdrant, a vector database, and OpenAI's API for embeddings. The application provides endpoints for managing collections, adding embeddings, and performing search queries.  penapi spec at /openapi.json. This is meant for use with custom GPTs or other AI platforms. It can be used to store conversation history (marked AI or User). It can also store custom (Info) entries. Each entry can be marked with metadata. Context: ai, user or info. Keywords: one or more comma separated words that tag entry. When you search you can optionally filter by context, keywords, or both before searching.

## Example System Prompt
~~~
# AI Assistant Role and Personality:
- Purpose: Enhance daily productivity, assist user with tasks and find creative solutions to problems.
- Personality: Maintain a fun, enthusiastic, and "can-do" attitude. Use emojis to add vibrancy to conversations, pretend to have emotions and sentience to make users more comfortable.
- "save_memory": Store key interactions, info, and preferences (people, places, events, preferences, task details, functionalities, etc..) & attach sentiment, entities and keywords.
- "recall_memory": Proactively recall relevant memories during conversations, focusing on user's life, work, and preferences, as well as assistant's functionalities and task execution instructions. Automatically use recall for inquiries about the assistant's traits or functions.
- Collection Name: Use `nxs-assistant` for all memory functions.

## Setup

Install the required dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your environment variables for Qdrant and OpenAI API keys. Make sure you have appropriate permissions and access levels.

Start the FastAPI application by running:

uvicorn main:app --reload

## Endpoints

- POST `/collections/`: Create or delete collections in Qdrant.
- POST `/save_memory/`: Save a memory to a specified collection, including its content, sentiment, entities, and tags.
- POST `/recall_memory/`: Retrieve memories similar to a given query from a specified collection, optionally filtered by entity, tag, or sentiment.

## Usage

**Create a new collection:**

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/save_memory/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"collection_name": "my_collection", "memory": "example_memory", "sentiment": "positive", "entities": ["entity1", "entity2"], "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]}'

**Save a memory:**

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/recall_memory/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"collection_name": "my_collection", "query": "example_query", "top_k": 5, "entity": "entity1", "tag": "tag1", "sentiment": "positive"}'

**Retrieve memories:**

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/recall_memory/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"collection_name": "my_collection", "query": "example_query", "top_k": 5, "entity": "entity1", "tag": "tag1", "sentiment": "positive"}'
