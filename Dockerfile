**Explanation of Change:**
* **Combined RUN Command:** In the build stage, we now combine the commands for installing build dependencies, Python packages, and removing build dependencies into a single `RUN` instruction using the `&&` operator. This reduces the number of layers in the image and can potentially improve build performance.
**Benefits of Combining RUN Commands:**
* **Reduced Image Layers:** Each `RUN` instruction creates a new layer in the Docker image. By combining commands, you create fewer layers, resulting in a smaller and more efficient image.* **Improved Build Performance:** Docker can cache layers more effectively when there are fewer of them, potentially speeding up subsequent builds.
**Note:** While combining commands can be beneficial, it's important to strike a balance. If you have a large number of commands or complex logic, it might be better to keep them separate for readability and maintainability.
